## Quick orientation

This is a small Django project (settings docstring indicates Django 5.2.7). The repo follows a standard Django layout:

- Project package: `alx_travel_app/` (contains `settings.py`, `urls.py`, `wsgi.py`, etc.)
- Local app: `listings/` (models, views, tests, admin are present but currently skeletal)

Key files to inspect for behavior and conventions:
- `alx_travel_app/settings.py` — uses `django-environ` to load environment variables and configures installed apps: `rest_framework`, `corsheaders`, `drf_yasg`, and the local `listings` app.
- `alx_travel_app/urls.py` — currently only exposes the Django admin. App URL includes are expected to be added here.
- `manage.py` — standard Django CLI entrypoint.
- `listings/` — application code (models, views, admin, tests). Files are present but mostly placeholders.

Note: `requirement.txt` exists but is empty. `settings.py` references environment variables for DB and SECRET_KEY and expects a `.env` file.

## Big-picture architecture / intent

- Monolithic Django app with one primary domain app: `listings`.
- API-oriented stack: `djangorestframework` + `drf_yasg` (Swagger/schema generation). CORS is enabled via `corsheaders`.
- Database and sensitive values are supplied via environment variables (see `settings.py`). Expect typical Django DB workflows (migrations, management commands).

Why things are structured this way (inferred from code):
- Using `django-environ` centralizes config via env vars and makes the project 12-factor friendly.
- `drf_yasg` + `rest_framework` indicate the project intends to expose REST endpoints with autogenerated docs.

Important implementation details discovered (useful for code edits):
- `settings.py` reads environment variables; ensure a `.env` (or environment) is present for local runs: SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, DB_*, DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS, etc.
- `alx_travel_app/urls.py` does not include app URL configs. If adding endpoints, also add `path('api/', include('listings.urls'))` (or similar) to project URLs.
- `listings/` currently contains placeholder files. Implementations (models, serializers, viewsets, routers) should follow Django + DRF idioms.

Example code patterns to follow (where to add them):
- Add app-level routing at `listings/urls.py` and include from `alx_travel_app/urls.py`.
- Register viewsets with DRF routers (e.g. `DefaultRouter`) and expose via `api/` prefixes.

Developer workflows (project-specific)

- Create and activate virtualenv, install required packages. The repo has no pinned requirements file; the known dependencies from `settings.py` are:
  - Django (~5.2)
  - djangorestframework
  - django-environ
  - django-cors-headers
  - drf-yasg

- Local dev run (assumes `.env` present and dependencies installed):
  - Run migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations; python manage.py migrate`
  - Run dev server: `python manage.py runserver`
  - Run tests: `python manage.py test`

Edge-cases and gotchas discovered

- `settings.py` expects `BASE_DIR` when reading `.env`. The file calls `environ.Env.read_env(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '.env'))` before `BASE_DIR` is defined in the file — be cautious: local behavior depends on how Python evaluates this file in the current environment. If you see failures loading env, check the ordering in `settings.py` or set environment variables outside of `.env`.
- `requirement.txt` is empty; CI or developers may need to assemble a `requirements.txt` from installed packages.

Integration points and external services

- Database: configured by env vars (`DB_ENGINE`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`). Tests and migrations will rely on a DB backend (sqlite, postgres, etc.) set via these vars.
- Swagger/Schema: `drf_yasg` is installed — expect to add schema view wiring under `alx_travel_app/urls.py` or an `api/` module.

Conventions and patterns

- Use environment variables for all secrets/config (see `settings.py`).
- Keep app-level URL modules and include them from the project `urls.py`.
- Use DRF viewsets + routers for API endpoints (project already has DRF listed in INSTALLED_APPS).

What to do when making changes (practical checklist for the agent)

1. Run quick repo scan: check `settings.py` for env expectations and `INSTALLED_APPS` for 3rd-party packages.
2. If adding endpoints: add `listings/urls.py`, register viewsets, and include them in `alx_travel_app/urls.py` under an `api/` path.
3. If running locally: ensure `.env` or equivalent env vars exist. Use `python manage.py migrate` then `runserver`.
4. Update `requirement.txt` when adding dependencies.

When in doubt, inspect these files first:
- `alx_travel_app/settings.py` (config, installed apps)
- `alx_travel_app/urls.py` (top-level routing)
- `listings/` (app code and tests)

If you want changes merged into this file or additional instructions (CI, linter, tests), tell me what workflows you'd like automated and I'll extend this guidance.
